## ðŸ§ª Running Tests

Each package in this project includes its own test suite.

To run the tests for a specific package:

1. Navigate into the package directory. For example:

```bash
cd matrix
```

2. Then run the tests with verbose output:

```bash
go test -v
```

This ensures you're testing the code relevant to that specific module.

You can also run all tests in the project recursively with:

```bash
go test -v ./...
```
